This project implements a basic "Hello, World!" application in TypeScript to validate repository setup and development workflows. It uses pnpm for package management, Nix for environment reproducibility, and Node.js 22 to execute the compiled TypeScript code, ensuring workspace configuration, shared configurations, and compilation processes work seamlessly. By doing so, it addresses the need for a reliable starting point for future TypeScript-based projects in the repository.
